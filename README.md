# Election-Analysis

Overview of Election Audit: The audit of the election made us to see the holistic results of the election conducted. We were able to determine the total number of the votes cast by the voters, the number of candidates that contested the election and the number of votes received by each of them. We were able to determine the percentage of votes each candidate received and won. Most importantly, we were able to determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote and the candidate that received the highest votes.

Election_Audit-Summary:  
    
The scripts used for the analysis of the results of the elections are comprehensive and very easy to understand using python program. These scripts can be used for future elections, whether congresssional or senate elections, or presidential elections, we just need to do little modifications. I am thereby using this medium to introduce a business proposal to the Election Commission in the United States to partner with us as we have the applications and technologies that make election results very easy to audit.
